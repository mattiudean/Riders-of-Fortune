// The player is Yarra, an adventurer who must traverse a one-dimensional array of random events from right to left to fight a dragon.     //
// Combat is done through the use of a 6 sided die; the player rolls a die and if the number + the weapon modifier total more than the     //
// monster's HP, they win. Otherwise, the game is over.                                                                                    //

// The player rolls a d6 to find out how many spaces they may move. Upon landing, one of three things happen:                              //
//                player finds a weapon,                                                                                                   //

//                or nothing.                                                                                                              //

// From there, the player may dismount and engage the encounter or keep moving. When reaching the dragon, the player must have a minimum   //
// XP or else they lose.                                                                                                                   //
